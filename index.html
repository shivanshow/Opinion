            <p>
                <strong>Otaku:</strong> A Japanese term that originally referred to a young person who is obsessed with computers or particular aspects of popular culture, such as anime, manga, and video games.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Weeb:</strong> A term, often used outside of Japan, to describe a non-Japanese person who is obsessed with Japanese culture, particularly anime, manga, and video games. The term can sometimes be derogatory or used in a joking manner.

            <h2>Comparison</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Origin:</strong> Otaku is a Japanese term, while weeb is a term used primarily outside of Japan.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Language:</strong> Otaku may have a more in-depth knowledge of the Japanese language than weebs, as they are often more invested in the original sources of Japanese media.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Interests:</strong> Both otaku and weebs share an interest in Japanese pop culture, but otaku might have a broader range of interests that extend beyond anime, manga, and video games.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Perception:</strong> In Japan, the term "otaku" can have negative connotations, while "weeb" is not typically used within Japanese culture. Outside of Japan, "weeb" is often seen as a more extreme form of being an otaku.
                </li>

            <h2>Opinions</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Weeb:</strong> Now, let's be real. A "weeb" is that cringe-worthy character who takes their love for Japan to cringey extremes. We're talking about the person who thinks using broken Japanese phrases and watching anime 24/7 makes them the ultimate Japanophile. Newsflash: it doesn't.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Otaku:</strong> Now, let's talk "otaku." These are the folks who've found sanctuary in the world of anime and manga. They've embraced it with a genuine passion, not as a substitute for an actual personality. Unlike the weeb, they don't make everyone around them cringe with cultural appropriation. They're the enthusiasts who appreciate the art and storytelling, not the ones trying too hard.
